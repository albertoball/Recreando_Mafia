# MAFIA REMAKE EN UNITY

Alberto Ballester
Recreating the first Mafia game as a learning project

## About the Project

This is a personal Youtube project where I'm recreating the first Mafia game in Unity as a technical exercise.
The goal is not to make a commercial remake.
The goal is to:
- Understand how classic game systems were built
- Recreate mechanics from scratch
- Improve programming foundations
- Study pacing, structure and scene construction
- Document the journey

## What This Repository Contains

- Unity project files
- Core gameplay systems (movement, camera, etc.)

## Youtube Series

This repository is connected to a Youtube series where I document:
- System design decisions
- Implementation challenges
- Mistakes
- What I would do differently

## Disclaimer

This is a non-commercial educational project.

All rights to the original Mafia game belong to their respective owners.
This project is made for learning purposes only.

If you own rights to any related material and would like something removed, feel free to reach out.

## What You Can Do

You are free to:

- Download the project
- Study the code
- Modify it
- Break it
- Improve it

If you build something interesting from it, I'd genuinely like to see it.

## Engine Version

Unity: 6.000.0.59f
